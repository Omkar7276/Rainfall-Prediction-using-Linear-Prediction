# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Linear-Prediction

The goal is to predict the amount of rainfall in certain region.

I obtained a dataset from Kaggle and imported it into a Jupyter Notebook. I then performed data cleaning techniques on the dataset to prepare it for analysis. After cleaning the data, I utilized a linear regression model from Scikit-learn to train the dataset. The model was trained using various input columns such as temperature, dew point, and pressure, to predict weather conditions based on these attributes.

By analyzing the data, we can observe that high temperature and humidity are positively correlated with high rainfall.
